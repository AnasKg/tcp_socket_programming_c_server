# Implementation of TCP Socket Programming Server Side in c Programming

This program is about TCP socket server side with c programming language and Linux libraries (not with “Winsock programming interface”). This is a server side application. After the TCP connection is established with client, the simple message application is started. Client and server can have communication with that messenger interface.
